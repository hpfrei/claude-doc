## Scope

claude-doc is a local development tool that proxies API traffic. Key areas of concern include:

- Exposure of API keys or credentials through the proxy or dashboard
- Unauthorized access to the dashboard or proxy endpoints
- Code injection via crafted prompts or API responses

## Best Practices

When running claude-doc, keep in mind:

- The **proxy** binds to `localhost` only — it is not reachable from other machines
- The **dashboard** binds to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) so you can access it from other devices — it is protected by an auth token, but avoid exposing it to untrusted networks without additional safeguards (TLS, VPN, firewall)
- API keys are forwarded to the Anthropic API but are never logged or persisted by claude-doc
- Interaction logs saved to disk may contain sensitive data from your prompts and responses
